The project is created during the MLOps course on HSE master program in ML Engineering.

Tasks of the project:

- set up PostgreSQL on local machine
- set up MLFlow on local machine
- set up connection to Yandex S3 service
- build dag for full pipeline of ML model cycle (data engineering + ML models training)
